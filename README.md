# Interactive web apps at the Edge with Remix, Neon, and Prisma

---

Slides for this talk are also available [here](https://jkomyno-kongres-nextjs-2024.vercel.app/).

## Abstract

Embark on an interactive journey with Alberto, as he explores React development using Remix, Edge deployments via Cloudflare Pages, and serverless data storage with Neon. You will learn the key advantages of Edge computing runtime platforms, and how to adapt your Remix apps for them.

Moreover, you will see how to query a Neon database using the familiar and type-safe Prisma ORM.

Finally, you will gain practical insights about the nuances and caveats of Edge platforms, as Alberto shares firsthand experiences from making the Prisma internals compatible with this innovative computing stack. Are you ready for the future?

## Requirements

- [Node.js 20.9.0](https://nodejs.org/en) or superior*
- [pnpm 8.9.2](https://pnpm.io/installation) or superior*

(*) These are the versions used to develop this repository. Older versions might work as well, but they haven't been tested.

## Development

- Install the dependencies via:
  ```sh
  pnpm i
  ```

- Emulate the Cloudflare runtime locally via:
  ```sh
  pnpm dev
  ```

  This will spin up a Remix dev server and a Wrangler dev server.
  Open up [http://127.0.0.1:8788](http://127.0.0.1:8788) and you should be ready to go!

## Deployment

Cloudflare Pages are currently only deployable through their Git provider integrations.

If you don't already have an account, then [create a Cloudflare account here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/pages) and after verifying your email address with Cloudflare, go to your dashboard and follow the [Cloudflare Pages deployment guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-anything).

Configure the "Build command" should be set to `npm run build`, and the "Build output directory" should be set to `public`.
